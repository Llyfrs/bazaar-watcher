# Torn Bazaar Scanner

This is python script that allows you to choose what items on the market you want track, 
and you get altered when when a item with your chosen price (or below) appears. 

**As of recent changes to the itemarket and bazaars, this script is no longer working, I might update it at some point to work with itemmarket only using the new API v2.**
